    <h1>Denzel R. Brown's Coding Challenges</h1>

    <h3>Challenge 1:</h3>
    <section class='images'>
        <p>My approach:</p>
        <p>I approached this challenge, first, by extracting the values from the string input. After looking at simpler
            code, I feel as if I took a round-about way of solving it. After said values are extracted, we are then able
            to compare the values on a time scale ranging from <i>0-100</i> in both the hour and minute scopes. Below,
            you'll see, are the 3 stages I went through to successfully complete Challenge 1. </p>

    <h3>Challenge 2:</h3>
    <section class='images'>
        <p>My approach:</p>
        <p>I approached this challenge by simply creating an algorithm based off sample data. This challenge was amongst
            the easiest ones I've completed and honestly should be in the <i>very easy</i> section. Below, you'll see,
            are the 3 stages I went through to successfully complete Challenge 2.</p>

    <h3>Challenge 3:</h3>
    <section class='images'>
        <p>My approach:</p>
        <p>I approached this challenge, first, by telling my function how to sort the array, because when you sort an
            array with <i>.sort()</i>, it assumes that you're attempting to sort strings. Also, when attempting to sort
            the numbers, they were not sorted correctly, per the default behavior. My function took in two parameters,
            <i>a and b</i>, that represented any two elements from the array and based how they were sorted on my
            function's return value. Below, you'll see, are the 3 stages I went through to successfully complete
            Challenge 3.</p>

    <h3>Challenge 4:</h3>
    <section class='images'>
        <p>My approach:</p>
        <p>I approached this challenge simply by calling for the month and date with the <i>.getMonth</i> and <i>.getDate</i> functions, respectively. After that I set up a conditional statement that spit out a true or false based off of wether or not the date in question was Christmas Eve. This challenge was also pretty straightforward and probably should belong in the <i>very easy</i> section. Below, you'll see, are
            the 3 stages I went through to successfully complete Challenge 3.</p>
