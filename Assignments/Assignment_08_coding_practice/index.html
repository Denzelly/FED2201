    <h1>Denzel R. Brown's Coding Challenges</h1>

    <h3>Challenge 1:</h3>
    <section class='images'>
        <p>My approach:</p>
        <p>I approached this challenge, first, by  extracting the values from the string input. After looking at simpler code, I feel as if I took a round-about way of solving it. After said values are extracted, we are then able to compare the values on a time scale ranging from <i>0-100</i> in both the hour and minute scopes. Below, you'll see, are the 3 stages I went through to successfully complete Challenge 1. </p>

    <h3>Challenge 2:</h3>
    <section class='images'>
        <p>My approach:</p>
        <p>I approached this challenge by simply creating an algorithm based off sample data. This challenge was amongst the easiest ones I've completed and honestly should be in the <i>very easy</i> section. Below, you'll see, are the 3 stages I went through to successfully complete Challenge 2.</p>
