        My name is Denzel! I am a physicist, data analyst, musician, and much more. I'm currently
        a graduate student at Georgia State University where I've been investigating a 2-Channel Pot Detector, and
        subsequently the muon & neutron events we detect from it. I love research and have been conducting projects
        since my freshman year of undergrad. This is where my coding career began. Before moving on to other endeavors,
        I was working to create an application structured around FitBit's OAuth 2.0 framework that would allow my
        colleagues and I access to the real-time physiological data provided by the FitBit users who'd grant us
        permission. I enjoy
        learning new things and hope that one day I'll have the pleasure of helping others in
        their pursuit of similar goals.
