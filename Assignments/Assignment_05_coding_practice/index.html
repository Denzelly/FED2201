    <h1>Denzel R. Brown's Coding Challenges</h1>

    <h3>Challenge 1:</h3>
    <section class='images'>
        <p>My approach:</p>
        <p>I approached this challenge, first, by ensuring to compare the two variables at hand, 'f' and 'g'. Once establishing what I wanted to happen after comparing the two values during each call, all that was left was to clean up the syntax. This challenge was not difficult at all. The biggest challenge was figuring out what exactly I was asking my exterior function to compare. Initially, I was comparing the functions themselves, whereas I was really intending to compare the <i>value</i> of each said function. Below, you'll see, are the 3 stages I went through to successfully complete Challenge 1. </p>

    <h3>Challenge 2:</h3>
    <section class='images'>
        <p>My approach:</p>
        <p>I approached this challenge, first, by determining what my max and min values were for any given set. I first sorted the set in ascending order, with the <i>sort()</i> array.prototype, to then return the first and last values of each set by use of the <i>splice()</i> array.prototype which were methods that we recently discussed in class. Below, you'll see, are the 3 stages I went through to successfully complete Challenge 2.</p>

    <h3>Challenge 3:</h3>
    <section class='images'>
        <p>My approach:</p>
        <p>I approached this challenge, first, by Next I had to loop the function to store each array (data set) and finally stringing each said stored array together by concatenating each iteration. Below, you'll see, are the 3 stages I went through to successfully complete Challenge 3.</p>
